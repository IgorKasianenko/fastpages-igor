### Hello and welcome to my personal blog

My name is Igor Kasianenko. I live in Tel Aviv with my beautiful wife. We like to walk by the sea first thing in the morning, before we drink coffee. I am doing Deep Learning at [KanduAI](https://www.kanduai.com/producerecognition). I started this blog mainly to sort things out and free some head space.


Most of the technical posts may be just an expantion of "mind palace" or "Mind attic" described in book [Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://amzn.to/3aW7zCz)

[Place for blogpost about Sherlock's mind palace, Maria Konnikova book and my thoughts]. 

I want to write about coding, books and technical ideas in general. 


This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
