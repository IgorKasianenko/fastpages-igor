title: Why I started personal blog
---

First reason - [Rachel's](https://twitter.com/math_rachel) blog post ["why you should blog"](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) and Rachel co-founded fast.ai, and gave me great opportunity to enter Deep learning. 

fast.ai is - 
1. Deep Learning [library](https://docs.fast.ai/)
2. Massive open online [course](https://course.fast.ai/)
3. Friendly [community](https://forums.fast.ai/).

And other useful things like this [blogging template](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/), that was used to host this blog.

They use top-down learning approach, and this was first time after my school years that I really enjoyed studying. I tried to do other MOOC, but they were to slow and theoretical. Jumping right into code - this is what I liked and what kept me going with Deep learning at fastai. Hands on experience in training models helped me switch industry and start working at great start up. Now I am training models and creating exiting products like facial recognition, age gender detection on Android devices on the edge, as well as fruits and vegetables recognition for scales and self-checkouts in supermarkets (already in production! [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A57U0X8mQ7E)). 

In the end I want to thank Rachel Thomas and Jeremy Howard from fastai, [Yannic Kilcher, the YouTube guy](https://t.co/ELzX9BQZw5?amp=1), and [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) for inspiring me to learn new things and share knowledge with the world and to my wife for supporting me in everything.
